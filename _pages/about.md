I am a third-year PhD candidate at the University of Nevada, Reno in the Nevada Seismological Laboratory. My work is focused on studying fundamental earthquake properties through the lens of "big-data." As we collect increasingly larger data volumes from more advanced and widespread seismic instrumentation, we must reconcile our existing seismological frameworks and knowledgebase with novel methods, capable of capitalizing on these rich datasets. My aim is to work at this "big-data" intersection while remaining grounded in the fundamental philosophy that good science should serve the greater good.

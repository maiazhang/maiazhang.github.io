I present a high-resolution near-source catalog for the aftershock sequence of the 2020 $$M_w$$ 6.5 Monte Cristo Range Earthquake (MCRE) built from a to-date untapped nodal deployment. This catalog not only illuminates previously unobserved structure and spatiotemporal evolution of the aftershock sequnece, it also primes us to explore near-source properties that are often underobserved due to the paucity of high quality near-source data within seismology.

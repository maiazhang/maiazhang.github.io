This catalog not only illuminates previously unobserved structure and spatiotemporal evolution of the aftershock sequnece, it also primes us to explore near-source properties that are often underobserved due to the paucity of high quality near-source data within seismology.</p>

<em>Nearest neighbors clustering applied to a subset of the JMAC demonstrating the limitations of a point-source assumption at large magnitude events like the \(M_{w}\) 9.1 2011 Tohoku earthquake. This may be true for smaller events too (note that the “streaking” over short rescaled time intervals and large rescaled distance intervals remains visible pre-Tohoku).</em></p>
